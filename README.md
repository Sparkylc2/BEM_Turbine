This is the code developed during the first two weeks of the project.

I make no promises it works fully as intended (nor that it is optimally designed or correctly designed either), however it is functional ;)

A large majority of the codebase was only written once, and there are a few conflicting design choices which are a result of changing project priorities and developments.

The scripts repository contains the Fusion 360 script, as well as the plotting scripts and blade creation scripts.

The rest of the repository holds the code the BEM and ancillary routines needed for it to work.
